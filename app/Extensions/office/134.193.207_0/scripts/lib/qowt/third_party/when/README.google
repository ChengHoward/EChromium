Description:
  When.js is a rock solid, battle-tested Promises/A+ and when() implementation,
  including a complete ES6   Promise shim. It's a powerful combination of small
  size, high performance, and rich features:

  - Resolve arrays and hashes of promises, as well as infinite promise sequences
  - Execute tasks in parallel or sequentially
  - Transform Node-style and other callback-based APIs into promise-based APIs

Local Modifications:
  when.js is a commonJs module on which we ran browserify to get a single
  js file to include in our RequireJS environment. Unfortunately there
  can be issues with modules like these, especially if they have dynamic
  conditional code to load further modules via require calls. When.js does
  this to see if "vertx" (http://vertx.io) is installed. Since it however
  does not need this library, we have commented out the use of this lib.
  Also, we have backported a change to promise.timeout to allow the caller
  to specify the rejection reason from when.js 3.1
  Search for "QO MOD" in the when.js
