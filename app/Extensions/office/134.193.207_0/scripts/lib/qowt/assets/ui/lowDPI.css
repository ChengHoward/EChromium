DuSk TODO: We really need to clean up this css file.
We should genericse for example the toolbar adorments and
have a single .dropdown class that dropdown button widgets add
to themselves to get the little arrow on the button. This is better than
enumerating every action-button against that rule. And adjust the hiDPI css
to match.
