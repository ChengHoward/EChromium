  'qowt-localized' is an element that scans through all contained textnodes
  for keys which represent a string in the I18n module. The keys should be
  surrounded by double underscores.

  For example, if we had a key "action_copy" that was "Copy" in I18n:
  <qowt-localized>
    <div>
      __example_action_copy__
      <div>
        __example_action_copy__
      </div>
    </div>
  </qowt-localized>

  after being parsed it would become:
  <qowt-localized>
    <div>
      Copy
      <div>
        Copy
      </div>
    </div>
  </qowt-localized>

  Parsing happens during the "attached" callback, so if there are dynamic
  changes, you would have to call this.parseI18nKeys() when they are complete.
